## Table Entity Relationship Diagram

The table diagram for the relationships between CSV's
was designed so that, when all the information was put together,
the relationships between each CSV is clearly outlined and 
the final product is easy to understand.

## QuickDBD - http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com

QuickDBD was used as the visualization tool for the ERD. The resulting
graph is fairly intuitive and represents the relationships between
Primary Keys, Foreign Keys, and Unique Keys present within the database
very easy to map. 

## Tables

This section outlines relationships chosen between headers on
CSV's and other CSV's. CSV titles will be ennumerated and then
a list of headers with their particular relationship to other tables
will be listed. Three key types were used:

* Primary keys (PK) are generally chosen when they define the CSV that they're
a part of, such as department number inside the department CSV.

* Foreign keys (FK) are chosen when there are columns with the same information
in other CSVs but they aren't unique to the CSV that is being worked with,
such as employee number under the salary table, versus employee number under
the employee table.

* Unique keys (UNIQUE) are present only within that CSV and provide information
not found anywhere else, such as salary under the salaries table, or
titles for employees under the titles table.
